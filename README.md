# codewomen-personal-portfolio

**Description**  

This portfolio contains the work of CodeWomen to build a personal portfolio. It is a collaborative project and it is work in progress. 

CodeWomen is an international group of women who code, based in Barcelona, Spain. We are from different countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Our goal is to learn from each other and build applications and webpages together. The Personal Portfolio app is built mobile-first.

The project intends to create a general template for a personal portfolio that can be adapted for individual use. The user would be an HR professional or tech recruiter looking to recruit web developers. The problem statement we defined for this project is as follows:  

"As a recruiter I need to find a (junior) developer with proven skills and experience in a fast way, who preferably lives where the company is located, has a work permit and is available to start immediately, in order for our developers to have adequate capacity."
